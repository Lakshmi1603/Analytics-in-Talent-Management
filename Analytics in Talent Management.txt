SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EXERCISE:

1. Before starting the hiring process, we need to calculate all the relevant costs related to every channel, in order to make a well-informed decision, and ensure that the hiring costs do not exceed the budget, and to avoid wasteful expenditures. Quality of Hire, hence, is an accurate method to calculate such costs. 

2. As observed from the table, the actual/final costs of hiring from each channel, except "Agencies" differ from the original/initial perceived costs by a wide margin.

3. This tells us that, although Placement Agencies may look to be the most expensive channel initially, the final cost estimate is definitely accurate in terms of ROI.

4. The Initial Cost of "Walk-ins" is very low, hence it helps in keeping all incremental costs also low.

5. Although the initial costs for "Job Board" and "Referrals" are the same, the final costs turn out to be quite different, owing mainly to the low "First Appraisal Success" of "Referrals". However, the attrition rates through this channel are also the lowest. Hence, Referrals may be a good channel for positions requiring high stability and low performance improvement/growth.

6. Finally, "Job Board" and "Agencies" seem to be the best and most cost-effective channels based on "Incremental Value Addition", and also "Final Total Cost.
